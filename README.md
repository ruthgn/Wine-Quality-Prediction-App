# Wine-Quality-Prediction-App (In Progress)
This repository contains all the data and code used to build a machine learning web app that predicts wine quality based on its physicochemical qualities.

Kaggle notebook outlining the prediction model building process is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ruthgn/predicting-wine-quality-deep-learning-approach).

Files (Pending)
-----
* 
* Trained Keras model generating predictions on the app (/my_model).
* Dataset for model training--originally from the [*Vinho Verde* wine dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ruthgn/wine-quality-data-set-red-white-wine) (/data/train.csv).
* List of all packages in the environment where this project was built and run (requirements.txt).
* Sample CSV files for inputing bulk entries on the app (sample_test.csv).
* App source code (wine-quality-prediction-app.py).
