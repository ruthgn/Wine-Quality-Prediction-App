# Wine-Quality-Prediction-App

Demo: [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/ruthgn/wine-quality-prediction-app/main/wine-quality-ml-app.py)

This app generates wine quality score based on its physicochemical qualities.

This app shows you how to visualize and analyze explainable AI (xAI) models with Dash and IBM's AI Explainability 360 (AIX360). It uses a LogisticRuleRegression model trained on the UCI Heart Disease data set for predicting the presence of heart disease in Cleveland patients.

Kaggle notebook outlining the prediction model building process is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ruthgn/predicting-wine-quality-deep-learning-approach).
